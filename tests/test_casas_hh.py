"""Tests for the CASAS ``hh`` CSV export.

This export differs from the classic format in ways that silently break a reader
written for the other one: comma separation, a location where the sensor
identifier used to be, quoted ``begin``/``end`` markers, and a different
activity vocabulary. It also mixes two annotation styles in the same column,
which is the defect these tests exist to prevent recurring.
