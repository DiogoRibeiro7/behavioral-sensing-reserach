"""Score the frozen v0.3 candidate against v0.2 on the frozen external cohort.

This is the one-shot primary external validation. Running it against the frozen
cohort is not repeatable under the validation contract: whatever it reports
stands, and no parameter, mapping, threshold or cohort membership may be changed
in response and rescored as the same confirmatory evidence.

The script therefore refuses to run unless every input matches what was frozen.
It verifies the profile digest, the cohort manifest's own recorded state, and the
SHA-256 of every recording it reads. A silent mismatch would produce a number
that looks like the pre-registered result and is not.

Use ``--cohort development`` to exercise the runner on already-inspected
development homes. That path is for checking the machinery works and reports
nothing about the primary cohort.
