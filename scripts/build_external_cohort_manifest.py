"""Screen candidate homes for the external-validation cohort.

The contract requires the eligible test-home identifiers and raw-file checksums
to be frozen in a machine-readable manifest **before** primary scoring. This
builds that manifest.

Output is a candidate manifest. Freezing it is a separate deliberate act, and
the frozen artefact lives at ``artifacts/v03/external_cohort_manifest.json``;
this script does not write there, so re-running it cannot disturb a cohort that
has already been frozen.

The manifest records the revision of this script and the checksum of the
registry it read, so a frozen cohort can be traced to the code and the metadata
that produced it. The profile freeze records its fitting revision for the same
reason; a cohort without one would be the weaker half of the pair.

It is outcome-blind by construction. It reads resident-count metadata, file
sizes, checksums and activity annotations; it never constructs a pipeline, never
runs inference, and never computes a metric. Eligibility is decided by the
contract's six criteria and by nothing about how well a home would score.

Resident counts come from the Zenodo record description, which is the
authoritative published source and the same one identifying ``hh107`` and
``hh121`` as two-resident.
