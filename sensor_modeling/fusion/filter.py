"""Recursive multimodal fusion into a latent behavioural state.

:class:`MultimodalBayesFilter` maintains ``P(Z_t | O_1:t)`` -- the posterior
over latent states given every observation so far, from every modality.

It is a forward filter over a continuous-time Markov chain, which is what lets
it accept the traffic an ambient deployment actually produces: observations
arriving asynchronously, at different rates per modality, with modalities
appearing and disappearing as sensors fail and recover. Between updates the
belief is propagated by the chain's transition operator for exactly the
elapsed interval; at each update every sensor that had something to say
contributes a tempered log-likelihood.

Three properties follow from the construction rather than from special cases:

*A failed sensor is silent, not negative.* Reliability enters as a tempering
exponent, so a sensor with reliability zero contributes a flat likelihood and
leaves the belief entirely to the other modalities.

*Absence of evidence widens the posterior.* With nothing to condition on, the
prediction step relaxes the belief toward the chain's stationary distribution,
confidence falls, and the estimate eventually abstains instead of coasting on
a stale conclusion.

*Contradiction is preserved, not resolved.* Sensors pointing at different
states pull the posterior apart, which shows up as a lower confidence and as
explicitly recorded contradicting evidence, rather than being averaged away.
