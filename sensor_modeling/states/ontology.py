"""The configurable ontology of latent behavioural states.

The states here are deliberately weaker than the activities of daily living a
clinician would name. ``KITCHEN_ACTIVITY`` says the resident appears to be
active in the kitchen; it does not say they ate. Claiming food intake needs
evidence that a contact sensor cannot supply, so the ontology stops where the
evidence stops and leaves the stronger claim to be made -- or not -- further
downstream.

Transitions are modelled in continuous time. Ambient observations arrive
asynchronously and irregularly, so the transition operator has to be defined
for an arbitrary elapsed interval rather than for a fixed time step. A
continuous-time Markov chain gives exactly that: the generator encodes how
long a state typically persists, and the transition matrix over any interval
follows from its matrix exponential.

class StateOntology:
    """A configurable set of latent states with continuous-time dynamics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states
        Latent states in canonical vector order. ``UNKNOWN`` is not allowed.
    dwell
        Mean persistence of each state. Longer dwell means the chain is more
        reluctant to leave, which is what supplies temporal smoothing.
    rooms
        Room each state implies, or ``None`` when it makes no spatial claim.
    jumps
        Permitted destinations from each state. Defaults to every other state.
    circadian
        Optional per-state stickiness by hour of day: 24 positive multipliers
        each, where a value above one means the state persists longer at that
        hour. ``None`` leaves the chain time-homogeneous, which is the
        behaviour every previous release had.

        The dwell time says how long a state lasts. It cannot say *when* that
        state is plausible, so without this a resident motionless at 02:00 and
        one motionless at 14:00 are indistinguishable to the prior. Measured on
        real recordings, that distinction is worth roughly 0.1 balanced
        accuracy; see ``docs/real_data.md``.
