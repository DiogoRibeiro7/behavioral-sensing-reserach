"""Running the standard pipeline against a real recording.

Everything else in this package is scored on a simulator this project wrote.
This module runs the same inference, unchanged, over data the project did not
generate, which is the only way to find out whether the architecture survives
contact with reality.

It deliberately does not tune anything. No emission rate, dwell time or
threshold is refitted to the dataset. A result produced here is therefore a
lower bound on what the approach could do with fitted parameters, and an honest
measure of how far the declared defaults transfer.
