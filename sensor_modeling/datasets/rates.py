"""Measuring the event rates a real recording actually produces.

The emission defaults in :mod:`sensor_modeling.fusion.defaults` are *declared*:
chosen by reasoning about what a sensor should do in each state, not fitted to
anything. That is a defensible starting point and it is stated as such, but it
leaves an obvious question unanswered — are the declared numbers anywhere near
what real homes emit?

This module answers it for an annotated recording. For every labelled interval
it counts activations per sensor and divides by the interval's duration, giving
an empirical activations-per-hour for each ``(state, sensor)`` pair. Those can
be compared directly against ``EmissionDefaults.active_rate``, ``idle_rate`` and
``away_rate``.

It measures. It does not fit: nothing here writes back into the emission model,
because choosing rates from data needs held-out validation that a single
recording cannot provide.
