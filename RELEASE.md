# Release Checklist

This project releases from `main` only. Development and integration work can
happen on `develop`, but tags and GitHub releases must point to commits on
`main`.

## Branch Policy

- `develop`: active development, refactors, documentation updates, and release
  preparation.
- `main`: stable release branch.
- Release tags: created from `main` only, using the format `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

Do not publish a release from `develop`.

## Before Merging to Main

**First, read the status of the latest CI run on `develop`.**

```bash
gh run list --branch develop --limit 1
```

The `all checks passed` job must be green. A local run is not a substitute:
these checks execute on one interpreter, and the 3.11 import failure that held
up `0.2.0` was invisible to every local run while the matrix was red. If the
local suite passes and Actions is red, Actions is right.

Then run these on `develop` as a fast pre-check:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest -q
mkdocs build --strict
```

Confirm the release metadata is ready:

- `pyproject.toml` version is correct.
- `sensor_modeling/__init__.py` version is correct.
- `CITATION.cff` version and DOI metadata are correct.
- `.zenodo.json` is current.
- `CHANGELOG.md` has a dated entry for the release and a fresh `Unreleased`
  section.
- `README.md` badges, DOI, and citation text are current.
- `ROADMAP.md` still reflects the next planned work.

`CHANGELOG.md` is the single source of truth for release notes. Do not maintain
per-release `RELEASE_NOTES_*.md` files.

## Merge to Main

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge --no-ff develop
git push origin main
```

Verify the merge target:

```bash
git branch --show-current
git log -1 --oneline
```

The branch must be `main` before tagging.

## Tag the Release

Create an annotated tag on `main`:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Verify the tag points to `main`:

```bash
git branch --contains vX.Y.Z
git show --no-patch --decorate vX.Y.Z
```

`main` must be listed by `git branch --contains`.

## Publish the GitHub Release

Use the tag created on `main`. The GitHub Release body must be the matching
version section from `CHANGELOG.md`, not a separately maintained notes file.

For example, extract the `X.Y.Z` section into a temporary file and publish it:

```bash
awk '/^## \[X.Y.Z\]/{flag=1; next} /^## \[/{flag=0} flag' CHANGELOG.md > /tmp/release-notes.md

gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  --target main \
  --title "vX.Y.Z" \
  --notes-file /tmp/release-notes.md
```

If using the GitHub web UI, copy the matching `CHANGELOG.md` release section
verbatim and verify the target branch or commit is the `main` commit for the
tag.

## Zenodo Verification

After GitHub publishes the release:

- Confirm Zenodo created or updated the record.
- Confirm the DOI resolves.
- Confirm the Zenodo record links back to this repository.
- Confirm repository metadata links to the DOI.
- Confirm `.zenodo.json`, `CITATION.cff`, and README citation details agree.
  `pytest tests/test_project_metadata.py` checks this mechanically, so run it
  rather than reading the files.
- Replace the pending row in `ZENODO.md` with the new version DOI once the
  record exists.

## After Release

Continue development from `develop`.

A merge from `main` back into `develop` is required only when `main` contains
substantive file changes that are not already present on `develop`, for example
a hotfix made directly from the stable branch. A release promotion merge with
an identical file tree does not need to be merged back solely for ancestry.

Then:

- Keep the fresh `Unreleased` section for subsequent work.
- Open follow-up issues for deferred roadmap items when useful.

## Emergency Fix Releases

For hotfixes:

1. Branch from `main`.
2. Apply the minimal fix.
3. Run the relevant tests and pre-commit.
4. Merge the hotfix into `main`.
5. Tag and release from `main`.
6. Bring the substantive hotfix changes back into `develop`.

The rule still holds: release from `main`, never from `develop`.
