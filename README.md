# Sensor Modeling Research Toolkit

A research-grade Python toolkit for **interpretable, probabilistic,
privacy-preserving** analysis of behavioural sensor data, and for multimodal
ambient sensing in ambient assisted living (AAL), digital health and smart-home
research.

It provides an end-to-end pipeline from heterogeneous sensor observations to
explained alerts, alongside an established modelling core of Bernoulli
autoregressive models, hidden Markov models, change-point detection and
non-homogeneous Poisson processes.

> **This is a research toolkit, not a medical device.** Nothing it produces is
> a diagnosis, and no claim of clinical effectiveness is made or supported.
> Simulator results are not estimates of field performance; the pipeline has
> now been evaluated on real CASAS recordings and externally tested on a frozen
> 43-home cohort, with the evidence boundaries described below.

## 🎯 Overview

The **Sensor Modeling Research Toolkit** addresses the growing need for reproducible, interpretable analysis of behavioral sensor streams in smart environments. Unlike general-purpose machine learning libraries, this toolkit provides domain-specific implementations optimized for the unique characteristics of ambient sensor data: irregular sampling, frequent missingness, binary activations, and the need for transparent, clinically interpretable models.

### What the numbers mean

Most quantitative results in this repository come from the bundled simulator.
They have since been checked against real recordings, and the comparison
matters when reading them:

| | Balanced accuracy |
| --- | --- |
| Simulator | 0.816 |
| 22 real CASAS homes | **0.420** |
| Recoverable from those sensors by any method | 0.607 |

The simulator's figure sits **above** what that instrumentation supports even
for a supervised classifier with access to the labels. Simulator results are
therefore not an estimate of real-world performance, and should not be read as
one. The pipeline is close to the ceiling for the evidence it actually uses;
the gap is in information those deployments do not carry.

The frozen v0.3 candidate was also tested once on 43 single-resident CASAS homes
outside the development panel. The optional circadian prior improved the median
paired household balanced accuracy by **+0.0091**, with a 95% household bootstrap
interval of **[+0.0054, +0.0117]**; 37 of 43 homes improved. The effect is small
and does not establish clinical effectiveness or general smart-home performance.

See [Real-data validation](docs/real_data.md) and
[Known limitations](docs/limitations.md).

### Key Differentiators

- **Research-Grade Implementation**: Clean, documented, and tested implementations of established algorithms from recent literature
- **Unified Interface**: Consistent API across different modeling approaches for easy comparison and ensemble methods
- **Clinical Focus**: Visualization and reporting utilities designed for healthcare stakeholders and non-technical users
- **Lightweight Deployment**: Minimal dependencies and efficient implementations suitable for edge computing and real-time applications
- **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design allows researchers to easily add new algorithms and extend existing functionality

## 🧭 Observation, state, change, alert

The platform keeps five kinds of thing strictly distinct, and most of its
design follows from refusing to collapse them:

| Kind | What it is | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Measured observation** | A sensor reported a value at an instant | The fridge contact closed at 08:14 |
| **Derived feature** | A value an upstream device computed, carrying its own confidence | The radar reports 2 tracked people |
| **Inferred state** | A posterior over what the resident was probably doing | `P(kitchen_activity) = 0.81` |
| **Behavioural change** | A shift against the resident's own history | Sleep has trended down for three weeks |
| **Alert** | A judgement that a person should look at something | An `attention` alert, with its caveats |

A sensor event is not a behaviour:

```text
fridge opening      != eating
tap activation      != drinking
toilet event        != confirmed toileting
chair activity      != sedentary behaviour
door event          != resident movement
missing observation != inactivity
```

The state ontology therefore stops at `kitchen_activity` and makes no claim
about food intake. Two rules are enforced mechanically rather than by
convention:

- **A missing observation is missing evidence, never negative evidence.**
  Sensor reliability enters the fusion likelihood as a tempering weight, so a
  failed sensor contributes a flat likelihood and cannot look like a quiet
  resident.
- **Ambient activity is not automatically the resident's.** Occupancy
  estimation produces `P(activity was the resident's)`, which discounts
  evidence while a visitor or carer may be present.

The system can also return `unknown`. Abstention is a first-class output, not
a failure. Current real-data diagnostics show that the implemented confidence
threshold is not yet a reliable safety mechanism: confidence weakly separates
correct from incorrect predictions and becomes less reliable in the highest
confidence band. Version 0.3.0 exposes additional uncertainty diagnostics but
does not claim that abstention has been solved.

### Supported and unsupported claims

The distinction the platform is built to hold. The left column is what the
evidence supports; the right is what it does **not**, however tempting the
inference.

| Supported | Not supported |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence of kitchen activity | Food consumption |
| Evidence of bathroom activity | Confirmed toileting |
| Bed occupancy with sustained low movement | Clinically defined sleep, or a sleep disorder |
| A door was crossed | The resident left the house |
| A sustained change against the resident's own history | A cause, a prognosis, or a diagnosis |
| Reduced room-to-room transitions | Deterioration in mobility as a clinical finding |
| Sensor coverage has fallen | The resident has become less active |
| `P(resident generated this activity) = 0.5` | Identification of who did it |

Two of these deserve spelling out.

**`kitchen_activity` is not eating.** A fridge contact records a door opening.
Turning that into a meal requires evidence the sensor cannot supply, so the
ontology stops where the evidence stops.

**`sleeping` is not sleep.** It is bed occupancy accompanied by sustained low
movement. It has no relationship to polysomnography, and mapping it to a
clinical sleep concept is a further inferential step this platform does not
take.

## 🏠 Multimodal ambient sensing pipeline

```text
heterogeneous observations -> validation -> sensor health -> occupancy context
    -> multimodal fusion -> behavioural state -> adaptive baseline
    -> change detection -> restrained alerts -> evaluation
```

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `sensor_modeling.observations` | Canonical hardware-neutral observation model, sensor registry, boundary validation, clock-drift correction |
| `sensor_modeling.health` | Online per-sensor reliability, emitted as an evidence weight |
| `sensor_modeling.context` | Occupancy contexts and uncertainty-aware attribution, from anonymous evidence only |
| `sensor_modeling.states` / `sensor_modeling.fusion` | Continuous-time state ontology and the recursive multimodal filter |
| `sensor_modeling.baseline` | Adaptive, weekday-aware, non-stationary personal baselines |
| `sensor_modeling.alerts` | Restrained, explained alerting with deduplication and rate limiting |
| `sensor_modeling.simulation` | Synthetic households with controlled ground truth |
| `sensor_modeling.evaluation` | Problem-appropriate metrics and paired sensor-ablation studies |
| `sensor_modeling.online` | Incremental, snapshot-able orchestration |

### Reproducible end-to-end example

```bash
sensor-modeling demo --days 90 --seed 20240304 --step-minutes 10
```

Simulates a household with a carer and visitors, injects a three-day bed-sensor
dropout and five days of wearable non-adherence, loses, duplicates, delays and
clock-skews the record, introduces a genuine change in sleep on a known day,
then runs the whole pipeline and reports what it did and did not recover —
including its own false-alert burden. Two runs produce identical numbers.

### Sensor-ablation experiment

```bash
sensor-modeling ablate --days 14 --seeds 11 22 33 44
```

The CLI supports reproducible paired ablations, but reported conclusions should
use study-scale replications rather than the four-seed smoke-test example above.
In the 100-seed study, the eight-sensor configuration was 0.0073 balanced
accuracy below the full deployment (95% CI [+0.0063, +0.0083]), while the
five-sensor configuration was 0.171 lower. In the later frozen confirmatory
study, the pre-specified five-sensor deployment failed the 0.02 non-inferiority
margin with a gap of 0.1548 (95% CI [0.1531, 0.1564]), whereas an eight-sensor
configuration remained within 0.00529 of the full ten-sensor system.

> parameters. They are not estimates of field performance. Real-data and
> external-validation results are reported separately in
> [`docs/real_data.md`](docs/real_data.md) and the v0.3 release notes.
